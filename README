This exists because I refuse to use my phone to view a photo feed when I'm sitting at my computer.

# git clone http://github.com/tyler/instagram-web.git
# cd instagram-web
# bundle install
# bundle exec -s thin

It is important to use an EventMachine-based web server, as I use em-http to send requests to Instagram. Moreover, it is important to use Ruby 1.9, as I use fibers for sexier event-based codez.

Lastly, if you don't want to go through the trouble of running this locally, you can just head over to http://insta.drmcawesome.com and use mine. :)
